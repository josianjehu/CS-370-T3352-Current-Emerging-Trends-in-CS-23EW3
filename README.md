# Pirate AI

For this project I wastasked to implement a q-value model where the end goal is to train the model to succesfully complete the pirate game. During each epoch we are looking to run the scenario in which a random cell is selected until the game status changes. When the game status changes it determines whether you won or lost and depending on the actions taken the q-value gets modified to train the model. The model is trained when the win_rate reaches 0.9 or greater. Code that was previously given includes the game mechanics and also setting up the neural network model build.


## FAQ

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

A computer scientists program code, besides programing code they also analyze code to improve the code and make sure that the functionality that is intended for that program is met. Problem solving is a big part of what computer scientists do, this includes developing, debugging, testing and modifying. 

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I prefer noting everything down and making diagrams which help me analyze the overall structure of the program to come up with an optimal solution to the problem that is being worked on. I prefer thinking over more than one solution so that I am able to keep an open mind and avoid myself from getting tunnel vision. 

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I try to maintain ethics in mind when it comes to programming, although a program may seem simple and harmless it can contain a cluster of ethical issues. I like thinking about the end user and how my program can be used to cause harm. If I am able to think about these things before making the program public I can prevent problems in the future for me and the end users.
